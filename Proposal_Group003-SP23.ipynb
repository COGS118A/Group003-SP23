A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- In addressing the need for automated music genre identification for enhanced user experience on music streaming platforms, we propose a machine learning approach to tackle genre classification and personalized music recommendation.\n",
    "- Leveraging data features like tempo, rhythm, pitch, and lyrical content, our goal is to predict genre labels, a complex multiclass classification task that emulates the human ability to discern music genres. Concurrently, we aim to rank songs based on user preferences, transforming personalized music recommendation into an information retrieval task. Data used in this project will represent a variety of music genres and user listening habits, measured through both objective attributes of music and subjective user interactions.\n",
    "- Machine learning algorithms will be utilized to make sense of this data, mapping musical features to genre labels and user preferences to song rankings.\n",
    "- The performance of our genre prediction model will be gauged using standard classification metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a quantitative measure of our success in mimicking the sensitive human ability to identify sound."

    "# Background\n",
    "Music genre classification is a significant area of interest in digital music processing. The process involves extracting acoustic features of music, such as genre, rhythmic structure, harmonic content, duration, and the instruments played, using digital signal processing techniques. The classification plays a critical role in recommendation systems, audio libraries organization, and trend discovery<a name=\"ieee\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#ieee)​.\n",
    "\n",
    "Musical genres are human-made categories, defining different types of music based on shared features, including instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content. These genre hierarchies help in managing the enormous volume of music available on the internet<a name=\"ssrn\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#ssrn)​.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various approaches, including Multiclass support vector machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, K-means clustering algorithm, and Convolutional neural network, are utilized in building music genre classification systems. The use of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, has gained popularity in automatic music genre classification, with a comparative study showing promising results against traditional classifiers<a name=\"raghav\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#raghav).\n",
    "\n",
    "Music recommendation systems are another crucial aspect of digital music platforms. These systems predict and push user preferences based on user behavior and music characteristics. The development of these algorithms has shifted from merely focusing on individual user preferences to incorporating mutual recommendations among users<a name=\"hindawi\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#hindawi).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, music genre identification and recommendation systems serve as essential components of digital music platforms, enhancing user experience by organizing music content and tailoring music selections to individual preferences. These systems leverage machine learning and deep learning methods to analyze music characteristics and user behavior, thereby enabling accurate genre classification and personalized music recommendations."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Human sound identify abbility is usually very sensitive. People usually identify a music genre \"based on both objective and subjective measures\"<a name=\"Lippens\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#Lippens). When human subjectives is not possible to duplicate in machines, many music platforms still want machines to be able to identify such music genre as a source of feature preference. Music streaming platforms face two key challenges: accurate genre classification and personalized music recommendation. We propose to address these problems using machine learning. The genre prediction problem is a multiclass classification task, mapping input features (tempo, rhythm, pitch, lyrical content) to predefined genre labels. The recommendation problem can be defined as ranking songs based on user preferences, expressed as an information retrieval task. The problems can be mathematically defined and solved using ML algorithms. The genre prediction’s performance can be assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score."

    "# Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use a dataset from Kaggle [(Link)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vicsuperman/prediction-of-music-genre?select=music_genre.csv) that describes music genres: 'Electronic', 'Anime', 'Jazz', 'Alternative', 'Country', 'Rap', 'Blues', 'Rock', 'Classical', 'Hip-Hop'. This dataset is about 3 MB, with 50006 observations and 18 variables: instance_id, arist_name, track_name, popularity, acousticness, dancebnility, duration_ms, energy, instrumentalness, key, liveness, loudness, mode, speechiness, tempo, obtained_date, valence, and music_genre. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset, we will observe different genre of music with the digitized features of a music. We observed that for example, that many tracks of \"Classical\" music has a very high value of acousticness. \"Hip-Hop\", \"Rap\", and \"Rock\" musics have higher popularity values compare to other genres. We think that all the music element related variables are critical for such genre predictions. For example, tempo will be a critical variable to identify if a music is fast or not. And we will rarely see such fast tempo music in \"Blues\" or \"Jazz\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Base on the fact that most of the variables are being numerical values, we do not need much of data transformations to do. We might eliminate some of the variables that shows less importance after some analysis of the data and do some standardization to balanced out all of the variable values. "

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating multiple music genre classification results using models such as neural network, KNN, and decision trees, we will maintain an accuracy percentage of our model to show how efficient such model can be with only subjective features we gained from the data. We have also tried implement sentimental date values from the dataset to try relate as close as possible to the true genre. We will be spliting our 50006 observations into train, valid, and test datasets. Using methods such as nested cross-validation would gave us accurate results from multiple different algorithm based models. We will be mainly observe a KNN and decision tree model by comparing and contrast each runtime and accuracy. We migh also need to do one-hot encoding since our labels are multiclass categorical. By tuning the parameters, we will find the best number of neighbors for KNN and best fitted tree depth and criterion for decision tree model. Idealy, a neural net model should be more accurate and widely used. However, with limited time and knowledge on neural networks, our team plan on test such algorithm model after we have a finite solution first. Our solution model can help our main project problem by providing a source to music platforms to quickly identify a genre when music data are being imported to the platform. It will also be helpful when the music platform tries to build a recommendation system and apply such model to help label what type of music is each user listening to. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a benchmark model called \"music_genre_classification\" using Convolutional neural network(CNN) to perform music genre classification. [Link](https://github.com/ds7711/music_genre_classification/tree/master). This model has achieved an accuracy of 70%, which is comparable to the human accuracy. Such model can possiblly substitute human ears and identify music genres within 30 seconds of the music play. It will be more time saving and allow humans to apply their abilities on other fields with more time."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",

    "Propose at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model. The evaluation metric(s) you propose should be appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution. Describe how the evaluation metric(s) are derived and provide an example of their mathematical representations (if applicable). Complex evaluation metrics should be clearly defined and quantifiable (can be expressed in mathematical or logical terms).\n",
    "\n",
    "A mean accuracy from the nested cross validation would be the most desirable evaluation metrics that we will be using in this project. When we are doing a classification problem, we want to know how good is our model doing. In the benchmark model, the author provided their accuracy percentage on the test dataset. Our model first will classify test dataset music genres with the features only. Then we will take those labels accompany with the obervation ids to find whether or not the true label is the same as predicted label. Last, we will count up all the correct number of predicted labels and calculate the accuracy. The accuracy can be calculated using below formula: <br>\n",

    "Since we planning on using nested cross-validation, each iteration will contain a best accuracy. In order to compare algorithms to algorithms, for example KNN to decision tree, we have to average such accuracy in total iterations and compare them. So, we might need to do multiple cross-validations to ensure our model is working efficiently. "
