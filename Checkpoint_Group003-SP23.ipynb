    "# Background\n",
    "Music genre classification is a significant area of interest in digital music processing. The process involves extracting acoustic features of music, such as genre, rhythmic structure, harmonic content, duration, and the instruments played, using digital signal processing techniques. The classification plays a critical role in recommendation systems, audio libraries organization, and trend discovery<a name=\"ieee\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#ieee)​.\n",
    "\n",
    "Musical genres are human-made categories, defining different types of music based on shared features, including instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content. These genre hierarchies help in managing the enormous volume of music available on the internet<a name=\"ssrn\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#ssrn)​.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various approaches, including Multiclass support vector machine, K-Nearest Neighbors, K-means clustering algorithm, and Convolutional neural network, are utilized in building music genre classification systems. The use of deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks, has gained popularity in automatic music genre classification, with a comparative study showing promising results against traditional classifiers<a name=\"raghav\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#raghav).\n",
    "\n",
    "Music recommendation systems are another crucial aspect of digital music platforms. These systems predict and push user preferences based on user behavior and music characteristics. The development of these algorithms has shifted from merely focusing on individual user preferences to incorporating mutual recommendations among users<a name=\"hindawi\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#hindawi).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, music genre identification and recommendation systems serve as essential components of digital music platforms, enhancing user experience by organizing music content and tailoring music selections to individual preferences. These systems leverage machine learning and deep learning methods to analyze music characteristics and user behavior, thereby enabling accurate genre classification and personalized music recommendations."

    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Human sound identify abbility is usually very sensitive. People usually identify a music genre \"based on both objective and subjective measures\"<a name=\"Lippens\"></a>[<sup>[5]</sup>](#Lippens). When human subjectives is not possible to duplicate in machines, many music platforms still want machines to be able to identify such music genre as a source of feature preference. Music streaming platforms face two key challenges: accurate genre classification and personalized music recommendation. We propose to address these problems using machine learning. The genre prediction problem is a multiclass classification task, mapping input features (tempo, rhythm, pitch, lyrical content) to predefined genre labels. The recommendation problem can be defined as ranking songs based on user preferences, expressed as an information retrieval task. The problems can be mathematically defined and solved using ML algorithms. The genre prediction’s performance can be assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score."

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "By generating multiple music genre classification results using models such as neural network, KNN, and decision trees, we will maintain an accuracy percentage of our model to show how efficient such model can be with only subjective features we gained from the data. We have also tried implement sentimental data values from the dataset to try relate as close as possible to the true genre. These sentimental features are included as: popularity, acousticness, energy, intrumental, liveness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, valence. We might exclude \"artist_name\" and \"track_name\" since we want to focus on the element of a music genre as music it self instead of its title and author. For features such as key and mode, we will be doing one-hot-encoding to transform these categorical data to the same type as other features. As human, we are able to identify if such music is lively or not and base off that detect its genre. For this model, we want to simulate the same detection that our human can do toward the musics itself. We will be spliting our 50006 observations into train, valid, and test datasets. Using methods such as nested cross-validation would gave us accurate results from multiple different algorithm based models. We will be mainly observe a KNN and decision tree model by comparing and contrast each runtime and accuracy. We migh also need to do one-hot encoding since our labels are multiclass categorical. By tuning the parameters, we will find the best number of neighbors for KNN and best fitted tree depth and criterion for decision tree model. Idealy, a neural net model should be more accurate and widely used. However, with limited time and knowledge on neural networks, our team plan on test such algorithm model after we have a finite solution first. Our solution model can help our main project problem by providing a source to music platforms to quickly identify a genre when music data are being imported to the platform. It will also be helpful when the music platform tries to build a recommendation system and apply such model to help label what type of music is each user listening to. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a benchmark model called \"music_genre_classification\" using Convolutional neural network(CNN) to perform music genre classification. [Link](https://github.com/ds7711/music_genre_classification/tree/master). This model has achieved an accuracy of 70%, which is comparable to the human accuracy. Such model can possiblly substitute human ears and identify music genres within 30 seconds of the music play. It will be more time saving and allow humans to apply their abilities on other fields with more time."
